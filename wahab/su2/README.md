About SU2:

>   The SU2 suite is an open-source collection of C++ based software
    tools for performing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) analysis
    and solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. The toolset is
    designed with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and aerodynamic
    shape optimization in mind, but is extensible to treat arbitrary
    sets of governing equations such as potential flow, elasticity,
    electrodynamics, chemically-reacting flows, and many others. SU2
    is under active development by individuals all around the world on
    GitHub and is released under an open-source license.

(Thanks to Andy Moy for pointer to the sample collection & basic
how-to on running SU2.)
