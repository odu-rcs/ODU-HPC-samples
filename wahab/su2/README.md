SU2: A Multiphysics Simulation and Design Software
==================================================

About SU2:

>   The SU2 suite is an open-source collection of C++ based software
    tools for performing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) analysis
    and solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. The toolset is
    designed with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and aerodynamic
    shape optimization in mind, but is extensible to treat arbitrary
    sets of governing equations such as potential flow, elasticity,
    electrodynamics, chemically-reacting flows, and many others. SU2
    is under active development by individuals all around the world on
    GitHub and is released under an open-source license.

ABOUT SU2 SAMPLES

Sample files for SU2 included in this repository were taken from

https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials.git

The sample jobs in this folder and its subfolders are also made for
"Intro-to-HPC" workshop at ODU, hosted by ITS Research Computing
Services. This folder is also available on Wahab at the following
path:

    /shared/HPC-samples/su2_sample

More complete samples for SU2 code are available on Wahab and Turing
at the following path:

    /cm/shared/workshops/ODU-HPC-samples/wahab/su2

This sample is a part of "ODU HPC samples", a repository of sample
codes and calculations for various computational packages, available
for free at:

    https://github.com/odu-rcs/ODU-HPC-samples/

Feel free to modify the samples to suit your own need.
