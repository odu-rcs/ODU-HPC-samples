# Sample codes for HPC

Version 0.01

Date: 2017-03-09

This is a collection of sample programs, job scripts, and input files
to help new users become familiar with ODU's HPC environment.
These samples are furnished by Old Dominion University (ODU) Research
Computing Services and is primarily intended for ODU research
computing users.

The samples include programs written in C++, Python, and R and their
batch job scripts.

Sample scripts for SGE job scheduler for Turing HPC are also provided.
These sample scripts are provided in `turing/<LANG>` subdirectory for
samples written in the `<LANG>` languages.

Documentation and tutorials are provided in `docs/` subdirectory.

All programs and documentations are meant to be examples for learning,
as well as starting point to build your own programs/scripts.
Feel free to copy and modify them to suit your need.


## First-hand experience

The first example of computational task to try out is the
multiplication of two matrices.
Please see the details in [matmul1.html](docs/matmul1.html) .
In this task, you will learn about a batch job and how to submit a
batch job.



## Help

Turing's documentation is located at
